# Design decisions

The major product/design decisions behind KiwiDesk's Settings
app and menu bar, with the reasoning — so users understand why
things behave the way they do, and contributors don't relitigate
(or accidentally undo) a settled choice. Decisions from the
Settings redesign (#68, PR #88) unless noted; deeper rationale
lives in the linked issues. Architecture and code guardrails
live in `AGENTS.md`, not here.

## Navigation & saving

**Two-group sidebar, topic-named: "Design" vs "System".**
Every control either travels with the profile being edited or
is app-wide, and the old flat tabs hid which was which — the
single biggest source of confusion. The sidebar makes the
split part of the navigation, but names the groups by *topic*,
not scope (System Settings groups by subject, never by
per-machine/per-user scope): **Design** holds the
profile-scoped content (Spaces, Layout, Monitors, Appearance,
Behavior); **System** holds the app-level surfaces (Profiles,
Shortcuts, App Rules, General). Scope stays the underlying
model — the header's profile picker shows which profile
"Design" edits — it's just no longer the group label, since a
new user can't predict placement from "is this a Profile
thing?". The membership is unchanged from the earlier "This
Profile" / "Whole App" split; only the labels are topical.
(#68 §3.1)

**One stable save footer: Revert / Save a Copy As… / Save.**
The old footer showed up to seven differently-labeled verbs
depending on invisible mode state, but they expressed only
two intents: "persist to what I'm editing" and "duplicate
under a new name". Three stable slots, clustered at the
trailing edge. The header's profile picker names the edit
target authoritatively — a destination caption beside Save
duplicated it, read as confusing, and its fixed width split
the button cluster apart, so it was dropped. Adopt is not a
save verb — it lives with the raw-Lua content it migrates.
(#68 §3.12)

**One header bar: section title leading, profile picker
trailing; status only when non-nominal.** The section name and
the profile edit-target picker are related facts (what am I
looking at / in which profile), so they share one titlebar row
instead of a title stacked over a separate profile banner. The
picker moves into a trailing toolbar item, shown everywhere
except General (`showsProfileContext`) — App Rules keeps it
because its rules target profile-scoped spaces, so it is *not*
the same exclusion as `visibleWhileEditingStoredProfile`.
The status sentence is demoted to a conditional strip that
mounts only when there's something non-nominal to say
(divergence, unsaved, built-in, no-match, or a warning) — a
synced profile says nothing, so the common case is a single
bar and content scrolls straight under the blurred titlebar.
(#68 §3.1)

**"Unsaved changes" is a live comparison, not a latched
flag.** `isDirty` compares the edited config and Lua source
against the as-loaded baselines on every change, so manually
undoing an edit clears the footer again — a latched flag
kept claiming unsaved changes after the user had already
put everything back.

## Spaces & profiles

**The fallback space is an explicit choice, not "whichever
row is first".** When a profile switch drops a space, its
windows need a home. Tying that to the first list row (the
#75 interim rule) forces users to order spaces by system
constraint instead of preference — and the redesign made the
order user-owned (drag to reorder). So the rehome target is a
dedicated per-profile reference (`fallback_space`,
`KiwiDesk.set_fallback_space`), shown as a badge on the row;
without one, the first-of-list rule still applies, so old
profiles behave unchanged. Pull-to-first was considered and
rejected: it would have made reordering silently change the
fallback. (#68 §3.3, #75)

**Space rows are bordered cards; reorder is an axis-locked
handle drag, not a drag session.** A system drag session's
ghost follows the pointer on both axes and cannot be
constrained, and its drop choreography (snap-back flights,
ghost-over-row double vision) kept reading as broken. The
reorder is therefore a plain vertical `DragGesture` on the
grab handle: the row itself lifts (shadow + slight scale)
and steps slot to slot — it never leaves the column, only
the pointer's vertical position matters, and there is no
ghost at all. (`List.onMove` was rejected too: it brings
list chrome that fights the card sections and shows no
better affordance.) Each row is a bordered card, the handle
flips the cursor to an open hand on hover, and the name is
a visible rounded-border field of fixed width — renaming is
discoverable without clicking first, and the fields align
in a column.

**Space icons are recognition sugar; the name stays primary.**
Optional per-space icon (`space.icon`) shown where scanning
many small items pays off — space rows, monitor chips,
per-space shortcut labels — never as the only signifier.
(#68 §6.5)

**Deleting a space removes every reference it holds** (pin,
Main role, fallback, per-space overrides) — a leftover
reference would silently resurrect the space on the next
profile load. App rules survive by design: they're global,
and another profile may declare a space of the same name.

**Live state is the single source of truth for which spaces
exist; `gui.json` mirrors it, never the reverse.** A deletion
prunes the space from live immediately (windows rehome to the
fallback), not only when a later profile load happens to drop
it — otherwise the next save re-captured it from live and it
reappeared. The sidecar's `spaces` list is kept a faithful
copy of live *as of the last authoritative reconcile*: every
explicit prune — a `load_profile` (including a scripted
Lua/CLI one) or an in-place edit — writes the live set back.
Hardware-driven applies (monitor change, native-Space
binding) deliberately don't prune or mirror (the
no-shuffle-on-reconnect rule), so between such an event and
the next reconcile the list may lag; the cold-boot seed and
the next prune re-converge it. The one place `gui.json` seeds
*into* live is cold boot — a space that lives only in the
sidecar (no profile, pin, window, or `set_mode` backs it) is
seeded so it survives the reload. That seed is safe against
resurrecting a profile-pruned space precisely because the
mirror keeps the list current. Deletion is per-profile:
each profile is its own file, so removing a space from the
active profile never touches another profile that still
declares a space of the same name. (#77)

**Saved profiles lead; Presets demote once one exists.** On
the Profiles tab, the built-in Presets top the list only
while no profile is saved yet — they're a bootstrap tool,
and leading with an empty saved-profiles list would leave
first launch barren. From the first saved profile on, the
order flips: the user's own content takes the top — saved
profiles with the Desktop bindings that reference them
directly beneath — and the full preset list closes the tab.
No disclosure folding on any section — collapsed content
was tried and rejected as visual clutter; a plain order
swap carries the same priority signal.

**Native macOS Spaces read as "Desktop n", never "Space n".**
"Space n" is how KiwiDesk's own virtual spaces read, so
reusing it for Mission Control desktops made the two systems
blur; "Desktop n" is the name Mission Control itself shows.
Binding a profile to a Desktop is dropdown-only: the earlier
draggable profile chips duplicated the dropdown while adding
a chip palette row and drop-target styling — a second
interaction model with zero extra capability. (#7)

## Icons

**A curated, keyword-tagged icon catalog — because macOS has
no API to list SF Symbols.** The system ships the glyphs but
can't enumerate them at runtime, so every symbol picker ships
its own list. Ours is curated *with search tags* ("mail" finds
`envelope`), which searches better than a raw dump of ~6,000
names ever could. The full catalog stays reachable: any valid
SF Symbol name typed into the search appears as a result, and
any single character (incl. emoji) works via "Use as text".
One `IconPicker` serves mode icons and space icons. (#68 §6.4)

**Browsing is tabbed (Emoji first); search is global.** The
picker's popover splits Emoji and Symbols into segmented
tabs — emoji lead because space icons are the picker's most
frequent use — but a typed query searches both vocabularies
at once (the tabs stand back, like Character Viewer). The
button shows a glyph-sized smiley when no icon is set,
never a "Choose…" label: the text made unset pickers wider
than set ones, so rows wouldn't line up. Clearing is a
control, not a choice: the remove button sits beside the
tabs (disabled when nothing is set) instead of posing as a
grid cell under Recents.

## Shortcuts

**A shortcut is modifiers plus exactly one key.** Carbon's
`RegisterEventHotKey` (one key code + modifier mask) is the
mechanism, chosen because it needs no Input Monitoring
permission. Multi-key chords (⌘J+K) are therefore not
recordable — pressing a second key while the first is held
keeps the first and shows a one-key hint — and a
hand-written `cmd+j+k` is inert and flagged ⚠ unrecognized.
**Switch-mode shortcuts sit right under the mode strip.**
The rows that switch modes render directly beneath the strip
that defines the modes, ahead of the action groups — the
definition and its bindings read as one unit. The strip's
caption also states that "default" is the standard mode and
always the active one after an app start. Renaming a mode
shares Delete's gate (base modes are protected in
profile-override editing, #55) and rewrites the switch-mode
rows of the config being edited through the catalog's
single authority, so writer and import classifier keep
matching byte-for-byte (#4). Scope: a stored profile whose
sparse override targets the old name keeps it and
resurfaces it as a standalone mode — the same accepted
pre-release gap Delete has (the edit is a draft until Save,
so stored files can't be chased at click time). Saved
profiles get the same affordance: a pencil beside the
profile name renames immediately — file, adopted name, and
native-Space bindings follow, like Delete and make default.

**Modal modes are the layering mechanism**: a mode switch
gives a whole second set of single-key bindings, ergonomically
better than finger-twister chords.

**The recorder locks on full release; the preview downgrades
lazily.** Releases work through a burst window (~a third of
a second): the first release that downgrades a chord stashes
it, and a full release within the window locks the stash —
so staggered release order can't corrupt the combo (⌘ let go
a split second before J still locks ⌘J). The DISPLAY keeps
showing the stashed chord for that same window: an instant
downgrade made the combo visibly vanish right before every
normal lock-in. Only a genuinely lingering hold settles the
preview to what is actually held — then nothing stale can
lock, the field stays recording, and re-entry just works
(a preview that kept showing released keys read as stuck).
Correction is release-then-press (⌘J, J up, K down → ⌘K); an
overlapped second key keeps the first with a hint. Bare
Escape, click-away, and app deactivation cancel. (#68
recorder UX)

**Duplicates hard-block; system shortcuts soft-warn.**
Recording a combo another KiwiDesk row already holds is
rejected inline with *Steal* (rebind here) and *Go to* (jump
to the holder) — silent duplicates were the #34 bug class.
The taken-by notice already shows *while the chord is being
formed* (live in-app check against the edited bindings); a
macOS system-shortcut collision instead commits with a
persistent ⚠ — shadowing one can be intentional, and a
live system check could go stale. Conflict surfaces
(the banner and the "Assigned to…" row) re-derive from live
bindings on every render, so fixing the conflict anywhere —
clearing either row, deleting the holder — retires them
without a dismiss. (#33/#34/#35, #68 §3.6.2)

**One recorder at a time.** Starting a recording snaps any
other recording field back instantly. (#33)

**A catalog label's identity and its display text are two
different fields.** `KeybindingCatalog`'s `NavCommand.label`
(and `StandardLayout.name`/`.summary`) stay the stable,
English canonical text — persisted into `KeyBinding.label`,
matched on by `KeybindingImportClassifier` (keyed off `lua`,
never display text), and used to seed a new saved profile's
name (`freeName(base: layout.name)`). Only a separate
`resolvedLabel` / `displayName` / `displaySummary` — resolved
through `L(...)` at render time, keyed by the stable field —
translates. This keeps a language switch from ever rewriting
persisted data or breaking import classification (issue #9
follow-up: the original literal-routing sweep covered SwiftUI
view literals but missed catalog-defined strings).

## Overrides & appearance

**Overrides are visible-but-inherited, never hidden.** A
per-layout or per-space override row always shows — dimmed
with the inherited global value until its checkbox unlocks
it, and carrying a left accent once overridden so active
overrides form a scannable boundary. Discoverable without an
"Add override…" hunt, quiet without a wall of enabled inputs.
(#68 §3.4)

**Gaps are uniform-first.** One Outer and one Inner slider
for the everyday "more breathing room" action, per-edge
sliders behind a disclosure. When stored edges differ, the
disclosure pre-expands and the master slider disables itself
— asymmetric setups can't be blindly flattened. (#68 §3.14)

**The gap preview is a live 2×2 grid, not a layout
preview.** It teaches the outer/inner vocabulary: a uniform
2×2 shows both gap kinds on both axes, where a skewed
BSP-style split would only add noise at miniature size. It
tracks the sliders live — each of the six stored values maps
through a square-root curve (`GapPreviewScale`, 0–100 pt →
1–14 pt) so everyday 8–20 pt changes move visibly while the
top of the range compresses, and per-edge asymmetry renders
honestly as uneven margins. Deliberately not a "what will my
layout look like" preview — that would be its own component.

**Colors are just the native well; hex entry rides the
system panel.** The inline `#RRGGBBAA` field originally kept
beside every well (the "hex stays first-class" round-1 call)
turned ten color rows into a wall of text boxes. The system
color panel the well opens has native hex entry in its
sliders pane, so the inline field was redundant chrome and
was dropped — the stored value stays a hex string, and
copy/paste theme sharing works through the panel. (#68
§3.14, revised)

**Appearance ends with the App Bar block.** Gaps and drag
visuals — the everyday controls — come first; the App Bar
(global style + colors + per-layout overrides) is the
deepest rabbit hole in the tab, so it sits last under one
"App Bar" group title instead of pushing everything else
below the fold.

**Drag & Drop explains itself in plain words.** The group
opens with one sentence on what dragging does (swap a
window's position with another), and Ghost / Drop zone are
smaller subsections — each with a one-sentence caption
("the position your window is dragged from" / "will snap
into when dropped") instead of the parenthetical jargon
titles ("dragged window", "swap target"). Section captions
are a `SettingsSection` affordance, so other groups can
adopt the same pattern.

## Shared controls

**Option tabs are a solid sliding-pill segment control.**
Every pick-one-of-few chooser (layout parameters, mouse
resize, icon picker tabs) uses `SegmentedPicker`
instead of the native segmented picker: a capsule track
where the selection is a solid white pill (light gray in
dark mode) wearing the slider thumb's exact crisp shadow —
the earlier soft glass-era shadow read as the pill "fading
out" — and the selected label is larger and semibold
— a real font-size step, because `scaleEffect` rasterizes
the text and reads as blur. Liquid Glass was tried in three
variants (bare, accent-tinted, clear + specular rim) and
dropped: bare glass over the flat settings background reads
as washed-out, tint reads as "blue, not glass", and the
glass layer blurs content near it. ONE persistent pill
slides between segments via matched geometry; styling
conditionally attached to the selected label proved to
crossfade on selection change (the view is destroyed and
recreated), so the pill is a single view that adopts the
selected segment's anchored frame. Segments are equal-width
across the track (full-bleed, like a native window-toolbar
switcher), a deliberate trade against content-sized
segments. One control, one look — a chooser reads as "pick
a tab" everywhere in the settings.

**Sliders share the pill design.** Every value adjuster
(ratios, gaps, sizes) is a `SettingsSlider`: the same capsule
track as the segmented picker, a native-style solid white
thumb that overhangs the track by 2 pt per edge, and a
full-strength accent fill up to the knob — the earlier
translucent fill read as disabled. A clear Liquid Glass
knob was tried and dropped: it refracted the accent fill
beneath it and turned blue. Accessibility is delegated to a
native `Slider` representation, so assistive tech sees
exactly the control it replaces.

**Rows share one label axis and one readout column.** Every
labeled control row (slider, segmented picker, dropdown)
puts its label in the same fixed-width column
(`SettingsMetrics.labelColumn`), so controls start on one
imaginary line across sections instead of each row picking
its own label width; slider readouts share one trailing
column the same way. The rows read the column from the
environment (`\.settingsLabelColumn`), and `OverrideChrome`
narrows it once (`overrideLabelColumn`, paying for its
checkbox prefix) — so a shared row dropped into override
chrome lands on the plain rows' control axis by
construction, not by remembering a width parameter. Numeric steppers are the
deliberate exception: label leading, then an **editable
monospaced field** plus arrows trailing (the native
System-Settings numeric layout) — a value embedded in the
label string ("Columns: 3") read as static text, and even a
plain readout beside arrows read as passive, so the value is
a real `TextField` (type a number, or use the arrows) that
commits and clamps on Return / focus loss. An optional unit
`suffix` ("ms") sits between the field and the arrows. The color grid is the other exception: its
two-column `HexColorField` layout keeps its own label width
(`colorLabelColumn`), because the shared axis would misalign
the grid's second column. Dropdowns ride the axis via
`DropdownRow` and take `.controlSize(.large)` so a menu
button's height sits with the capsule tracks around it.
Within a section, a `Divider` separates geometry controls
from the behavior dropdowns (overflow, new-window placement)
— eight-point uniform spacing alone let unrelated rows read
as one group.

**Buttons stay native; only size marks their class.** No
gradients, borders, or shadows on buttons — the crisp shadow
is reserved for controls that slide (pill, slider thumb).
Class is expressed through the system styles: one
`.borderedProminent` per surface for the commit action
(footer Save, popover confirms), `.bordered` at
`.controlSize(.large)` for row actions (Load, Apply) so they
sit level with the large dropdowns, `.bordered` for list-add
actions (a `.borderless` "Add …" read as caption text), and
`.plain` + underline + hover lift only for inline prose
links. Icon-only inline row actions (trash, ×-clear, the
rename pencil) stay `.borderless` — the native list-row
convention; only text "Add …" actions warrant a border. The
one smaller control is the Shortcuts import button
(`.controlSize(.small)`): it sits inline beside the mode
chips and must not read as a peer tab.

**A recording shortcut field wears an accent halo.** The
armed recorder among dozens of identical rows gets an accent
fill + ring extending slightly past the button — the same
accent-layer vocabulary as `OverrideChrome`'s active rows —
because a tinted border plus a label swap alone was too
quiet to spot at list speed.

**Status badges stay flat.** The thumb/pill shadow is the
settings' vocabulary for "interactive, movable"; putting it
on a passive `BadgeChip` would promise interaction the chip
doesn't have. Depth comes from the hairline stroke both chip
types now share, matching the flat capsule language of
native tags. A non-interactive value state in a control row
(the slot size's "Auto — orientation standard") renders in
the same capsule language rather than as bare gray prose,
which read as skippable filler.

**"Lives elsewhere" pointers are links.** Prose that names
another tab ("configured in the App Bar tab") is a dead end;
those pointers are `CrossReferenceLink`s in the
make-default link's quiet style, jumping the sidebar
selection through an injected `settingsNavigate` environment
action.

## Monitors

**One representation: monitor cards.** The old tab rendered
the same space→monitor mapping three ways (proportional
canvas, drag palette, resolution list). Equal-sized cards in
physical x-order hold the space chips that resolve to them;
a dashed "Follows main display" card holds the Main-role
spaces. Chips carry semantic micro-icons (pin/link) rather
than border styles alone (accessibility), ⓧ clears to
automatic, and the context menu is the keyboard/VoiceOver
fallback. macOS's Displays pane owns true spatial layout —
identity + order is enough here. (#68 §3.13)

## App rules

**One row per app, two facets.** "Finder lives on space 2
but its Get Info windows float" used to be two entries in two
differently-shaped lists. Now each app has a Space facet and
a Float facet; the `App:Title` colon syntax is assembled by
the GUI and never shown (it's serialization, not UI). Storage
is untouched, so hand-written configs round-trip. (#68 §3.11)

## Errors & the menu bar

**A half-loaded config is visible state, not a log line.**
`KiwiCore` publishes the issues of the last config load
(broken init.lua, unreadable gui.json, undecodable profile
JSONs); the menu-bar icon shows a distinct config-error badge
(permission warnings still win — without Accessibility
nothing works), and a standalone Config Issues window is
reachable without opening Settings. Profile issues also
refresh on save/delete, so repairing one clears its badge
immediately. (#68 §3.7, #39/#31 own the validation cores)

**The quick menu is for daily driving.** Header row naming
the live profile, a Switch Profile submenu (`load_profile`
finally has a quick path), Config Issues… only while
something is wrong, Support near Quit. Menu entries stay
monochrome template symbols; the colored tiles are a
Settings-window device. (#68 §3.10, §6.2)

**The real logo ships pre-rasterized, no asset catalog.**
Vector masters live in `/assets`; the app bundles plain
PNG/TIFF copies regenerated with macOS built-ins
(`assets/README.md`) because `swift build` on CI runs no
actool. The menu bar and quick-menu header render the mono
mark as an 18 pt template TIFF (macOS tints it; the old SF
Symbol stays as missing-resource fallback). About shows the
wordmark on a fixed light badge — its navy text is fused into
the artwork's compound path, so it cannot follow dark mode.
The color mark is reserved as the `.icns` master for when an
`.app` bundle exists. (#68 §3.8/§3.9)

## Out of scope, on purpose

- **Onboarding** is a separate follow-up pass (shares only
  the branding glyph). (#68 §5.9)
- **Configurable resize step** (#58) and **2-axis resize**
  (#56) have a reserved slot in Shortcuts ▸ Size & Float;
  the design there is additive so their arrival won't
  re-layout the section.
