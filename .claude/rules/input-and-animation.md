# Input & animation

Canonical for this subsystem (AGENTS.md §5 indexes it). When
editing here:

- Hotkeys use the **Carbon API** (`RegisterEventHotKey`), not
  CGEventTap — this avoids the Input Monitoring permission. Event
  taps are only for mouse drag tracking.
- Use **one `DisplayLink` per monitor** (mixed refresh rates).
  Never drive animations from a single global timer.
- **The spring integrator must stay inside its stability bound
  (#599).** `Spring.step` is semi-implicit Euler, which amplifies
  instead of damping once the step is large relative to the
  spring's response — so a 60 Hz tick diverged for every duration
  below ~80 ms, and the position ran away to infinity. It
  substeps to stay under `maxStableStep`; do not "simplify" that
  loop away, and re-derive the bound if the damping fraction ever
  changes (at 0.85 the damping term binds, but below 0.5 the
  restoring term would). Substepping rather than a duration
  clamp because there is one `DisplayLink` per monitor at mixed
  rates — 120 Hz was always inside the bound, which is why this
  reproduced on some machines only.
  **Why it mattered far beyond one janky window:** a diverged
  animation never satisfies `settled`, so it never leaves the
  engine, `activeCount` never returns to zero and `notifyIfIdle`
  stops emitting `onAllAnimationsEnded` — killing the deferred
  focus raise, the z-order restore and the overlay re-sync for
  the rest of the session. Anything new that waits on that signal
  inherits the same exposure, so keep the integrator honest
  rather than gating each consumer.
- Two env levers exist for device QA of this subsystem —
  `KIWIDESK_STRAND_LOG` (logs a window that did not land on its
  settled target, #47) and `KIWIDESK_NO_WS_TRACKING` (forces the
  overlays' AX-fallback path, #596). Both are documented in
  [tests.md](tests.md), which is scoped to `Tests/**` and so does
  not load while you are editing here.
