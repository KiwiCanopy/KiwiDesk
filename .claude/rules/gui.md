# Settings app & SwiftUI GUI

Canonical for this subsystem (AGENTS.md §2.7 and §5 index it).

## North star — simplicity, intuitiveness, Apple-native, in that order

**"Apple-native" binds behavior, not the Settings GUI's visual
idiom** (owner ruling 2026-08-02, argued in
`docs/design-decisions.md`). Controls behave the standard way —
focus, keyboard, VoiceOver, dark mode, drag and drop are system
conventions, non-negotiable. The window's information
architecture and look are KiwiDesk's own: the #678 redesign
deliberately breaks with System Settings, which is explicitly
not the bar. Two obligations follow — don't reject a redesign
surface for breaking System Settings' idiom, and don't read
"GUI ours" as licence for non-standard controls. Simplicity and
intuitiveness stay first and still break ties. When unsure, ask
a `ui-designer` consult framed by these priorities before
inventing a layout.

**Approachable by default, powerful on demand.** A new user gets a
good tiling setup with almost no configuration; that simplicity
must never *cap* what's achievable — beneath every easy surface is
a deeper layer (Lua config, profiles, advanced layouts, per-space
overrides) there when wanted and never required to begin. Depth is
a capability the user grows into, not a cost paid upfront. The
#326 panel is the shape: a glance surface with one "Edit in
Settings…" bridge down to the full editor.

**The GUI curates, Lua is open.** The GUI is the opinionated gate
that decides what most people *should* touch (safe defaults for
the rest); Lua is the unrestricted power layer. A Lua setter
clamps or rejects only genuinely-broken / unrenderable values (an
invisible alpha, a >1 factor, a malformed color) — never to
enforce taste or a ratio the GUI keeps tidy. Risky-but-valid knob
→ hide it from the GUI, expose it Lua-only, and don't add a guard
that second-guesses the power user (the bars' `dim_factor` /
`active_dim_factor`: Lua-only, clamped to a legible range yet free
to invert the dim ladder).

## Settled conventions — extend, don't relitigate

- **Group by topic, never by widget type.** A toggle and the
  control it gates are one decision, so the toggle sits directly
  *above* the control it gates, never in a separate "toggles"
  block. Colors, which gate nothing, may group by type for grid
  scannability — and since #678 Phase 3 they do so wholesale, on
  their own destinations. **A colour renders in exactly one
  area**, which is Advanced Colours; adding a `HexColorField`
  anywhere else in `Settings/` reds
  `SettingsColorSurfaceTests`, whose allow-list is the one copy
  of who may. Structure (is it drawn, how wide, how round) stays
  with its feature; only the tint moves.
- **Grey, don't hide** a control with no effect in the current
  mode (#171) — keep it visible and dimmed. This covers a control
  that *would* work in another mode, so dimming says "switch that
  on and I act".
- An affordance for a channel that **does not exist yet is removed
  outright**: dimming cannot revoke the promise its shape makes,
  and it reads broken instead of forthcoming (the site's App Store
  badge, removed rather than greyed — permanently, the store being
  out of scope; see `docs/design-decisions.md`).
- **The live preview leads** its editor.
- **Defer per-control "why" to contextual help** (the planned `?`
  affordance, #94) rather than bloating labels or captions with
  glosses that would later duplicate it. A caption's job is to
  label what's shown, not to teach.

Shared control conventions (help affordance, control choice, row
tiers) are elaborated in `docs/ui-patterns.md`; the durable
product/UX rulings behind them in `docs/design-decisions.md`.

## No window controller changes the activation policy

A content window comes forward with `NSApp.forceFront`, which
shows and activates it from `.accessory`. Never
`setActivationPolicy` from a controller, and never a helper that
wraps one.

`ActivationPolicySeamTests` holds the line and **its `allowed` map
is the one copy of who may** — today launch and the
single-instance alert, each for a reason stated there. The
argument, and why the rule is phrased as an obligation on
controllers rather than as a claim about the process, is
"Permanent accessory mode" in `docs/design-decisions.md`.

## File layout

Section bodies in `Settings/Sections/`, their widgets in
`Settings/Components/<area>/` — one directory per area, and
where that area is a destination the directory carries the
destination's name, so **renaming a destination renames its
directory in the same change set** (Appearance became
GapsAndBorders with its page in #678 Phase 3).
Shell/model files and root-composed widgets live at `Settings/`
root. `Common/`
admits only primitives shared across multiple component areas;
root-owned widgets stay at `Settings/` root. `Settings/Census/`
holds the `SettingKey` settings census (#678) — data enums only,
never views.

## The settings census (#678, redesign coexistence)

`Settings/Census/` records every setting's redesign placement,
tier, gate and text keys, and the redesigned GUI renders from
it. **Bars, Colours & Motion, Advanced Colours and Shortcuts
render from it now** (#678 Phases 2-3): `BarsRowOrder` /
`ColorsRowOrder` / `ShortcutsRowOrder`
hold the display order and `BarsCensusRenderTests` /
`ColorsCensusRenderTests` / `ShortcutsCensusRenderTests` pin
them to the census, so a row in
those areas moves by editing the census.

That promise has a stated edge in Shortcuts, and reading it as
unqualified will waste your afternoon: three containers there
are BESPOKE views, not `ForEach`es over an order list — the
layer strip, the app list and the raw-Lua drawer. Their order
lists exist so the census still records those rows for the
placement table and for search, and the guard holds their
MEMBERSHIP, but editing one moves nothing on screen. Which
containers actually render from the census is what
`ShortcutsCensusRenderTests` walks; check there before
assuming an edit will show up.

**The census's unit is a SETTING, and one setting may draw many
rows.** A keybinding family is the worked case: `focusDir` is
one census case that puts four rows on screen and `goToSpace`
one that puts a row per live space, so the Shortcuts area needs
a second seam the other areas do not — an order list saying
*where a family sits* and `ShortcutsFamilyRows` saying *what it
draws*. An area whose keys expand this way owes both halves and
a guard over each; **which keys may legitimately expand to
nothing is data, never a skipped branch**, because a renderer
reading `rows(for:) ?? []` cannot tell a hand-drawn container
from a family that lost its rows, and a guard that skips `nil`
goes green on exactly the disappearance it exists to catch
(proven against `ShortcutsCensusRenderTests` before it shipped).

**A capability unlocked in one list stays scoped to that list**
(#678). Once a profile carries a single shortcut override, the
override affordance is live on every row of that list — never
re-earned per row — and it turns nothing on elsewhere in the
app. Do not gate such an affordance on a Settings mode: mode
depth is per AREA (`SettingsArea.minimumMode`), never per row,
and nothing is read-only because of the mode.
`ShortcutsCapabilityUnlockTests` holds those three.
The fourth clause has no guard because it needs no code —
**never give an override resolver a mode parameter**;
`KeyLayerOverride.resolved(onto:)` takes a base list and
nothing else, and a flag deciding which shortcuts fire is a
second config the user cannot see.
Container-level greying is census-driven there (the container
gate plus `exemptFromContainerGate`), but a ROW's grey
predicate stays wiring-owned even in a census-rendered area —
the census `gate:` names the owning setting, the exact
predicate (resolved shown-bar values, auto sentinels) lives in
the row builder. A Phase 3+ area copying the Bars shape copies
that split too; don't expect editing a row's census gate alone
to change on-screen greying — and the reverse obligation holds
in census-rendered areas: **retargeting a row's grey predicate
updates that row's census `gate:` in the same change set**, or
the declared owner and the wiring drift apart with every test
green. Until
the *other* areas render from the census, their hand-written
views stay the behavioral authority — so **a change to a
Settings row's placement, its `GreyOut`/`disabled` gating,
or its `L()` keys updates the matching `SettingKey` entry in the
same change set.** The census's gates were transcribed from the
live wiring once; nothing mechanical can re-derive them from
views, which is why the obligation sits here, where every
`Sources/KiwiDesk` edit loads it. The 4f guards
(`SettingKeyCensusTests`, `SettingKeyLocaleTests`,
`SettingKeyModelParityTests`) catch the model and locale halves;
placement and gating drift only a reviewer — or this rule — can
catch. Text stays key-only: `scripts/extract-keys` reads the
views' `L(key, english)` call sites, so a change that deletes a
view must re-author its keys through a scanner-visible shape in
the same change or the keys are pruned from every locale.

## SwiftUI traps

- **Cursor changes use `NSCursor.set()`, never push/pop.** A view
  removed under the pointer (a link that deletes itself, a row
  rebuilt by rename) never delivers the balancing
  `onHover(false)`, and hover interleaved with a drag gesture pops
  the wrong entry — a cursor stack cannot balance. Bit the spaces
  drag handle and the link-hover modifier.
- **Keep `body` a shallow container.** A long modifier chain with
  conditional `background` / `overlay` closures, or
  `+`-concatenated string literals inside one `body` expression,
  can exceed the type-checker's budget — and the failure is
  machine-dependent: it compiles locally but dies on the slower CI
  runner ("unable to type-check this expression in reasonable
  time"), so the local verify gate does not catch it. Extract
  chained subviews into private computed properties / funcs and
  hoist concatenated strings into constants. Bit
  `KeyRecorderField`.
- A view `.disabled()` on a `.menu` `Picker` is **unreliable** —
  it blocks selection but won't grey. Never make it the sole gate
  on a side effect; guard the setter too, and grey the picker
  rather than the row so a `?` affordance stays live.

## Strings

Nearly every `L()` call site in the repo is in this tree, so the
authoring rules apply here even though the catalogs live in Core:

- Every user-facing string goes through `L("key", "English")`
  (issue #9). English is the source of truth, inlined at the call
  site.
- A value interpolated into a sentence (a name, a count) MUST use
  the `L(key, english, args...)` overload with **positional**
  `%1$@` / `%1$d` specifiers — never `+`-concatenated fragments.
  A translation cannot reorder pieces stitched together in Swift,
  and many languages need to.
- **Never hand-edit `Resources/Locales/*.json`.** `en.json` is
  regenerated from real call sites; the other catalogs are
  translation-owned and edited only through `scripts/*-key(s)`.
- A cosmetic English edit (typo, punctuation) keeps translations;
  a **meaning** change runs `scripts/drop-key <key>` in the same
  change set.

The tooling, the content guards and the "Core names, the
GUI narrates" seam (#96) are in
[localization.md](localization.md).
