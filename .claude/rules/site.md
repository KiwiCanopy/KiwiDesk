# Marketing / docs site (`site/`)

Canonical for this subsystem (AGENTS.md §3 and §5 index it).

## `docs/` reaches the site through a symlink

Doc *content* edits flow to the site automatically — **never
hand-copy a doc into `site/`**. The symlink is not full coverage
though:

- a **new doc page** needs a sidebar entry in
  `site/astro.config.mjs`;
- **site-only surfaces** (the landing page, cross-page callouts)
  are updated in the same change set when a feature warrants
  surfacing there — e.g. a new layout mode (#128) adds its
  user-guide / reference prose *and* whatever nav or callout makes
  it findable.
- `site/src/assets/brand` is a symlink to the repo's `assets/`.
- Site i18n is hand-maintained (not generated from the app
  catalogs).

## Build

Run `npm run build` in `site/` when you touch either, after
`nvm use` there. **`site/.nvmrc` is the one copy of the Node
version** — read by that command and by CI's `node-version-file`,
so never restate the number in prose or in `site.yml`.

Astro refuses anything below 22.12, and an install performed on an
older Node resolves the wrong platform binaries, so a later
`nvm use` alone still fails on a missing native binding — delete
`node_modules` and reinstall if that happens.

## Template comments ship to visitors (#557)

An `.astro` **template** comment written `<!-- ... -->` is emitted
verbatim into `dist/` and downloaded by everyone; only JSX-style
`{/* ... */}` is stripped at build.

The design rationale in `site/src/**` — the notes citing AGENTS.md
sections, issue numbers and `docs/` paths that explain a
non-obvious UX call, e.g. why there is deliberately no App Store
badge — is worth keeping in the source and must use `{/* */}`.
`Guide.astro` and `Landing.astro` published ~22 KB of it across
the locales before #557.

Two places are **not** template: frontmatter (between the `---`
fences) is already JS, so leave it alone; and inside
`<script is:inline>` / `<style>` Astro treats the body as raw
text, where a JSX comment renders literally — use `//` there.

A comment body containing `*/` self-terminates early, so check
before a bulk swap. Verify one by rebuilding the pre-change
baseline, regex-stripping `<!--.*?-->` from its output and diffing
against the new build: byte-identical across every page proves no
markup was swallowed by a mis-terminated delimiter, which counting
`<section` only weakly suggests.
